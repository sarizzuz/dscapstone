# Capstone Project for the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

## Overview
Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

I went to the

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. In this capstone you will work on understanding and building predictive text models like those used by SwiftKey.

This course will start with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It will cover cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, you will use the knowledge you gained in data products to build a predictive text product you can show off to your family, friends, and potential employers.

This project involves: 
1. Analysis of text data and; 
2. Natural language processing. 

This repository contains the code for:
1. The pre-processing of the data set as provided by Swiftkey.
2. A milestone report that outlines the initial exploration of the datasets.
3. The ngram modeling
4. The word prediction model
5. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), and it predicts the next word.
5. A slide deck created with R presentations pitching the algorithm and app.
